FINGERPRINT TEMPLATE PROTECTION USING PATTERN  TRANSFORMATION :The fingerprint template protection using pattern transformation technique has been proposed with keeping in mind the challenges prevailing in the field of biometric template security arena in preserving privacy. Analysis of user behavior or traits is important in the field of security systems. The better we do to secure systems, the more it helps in privacy protection. This project has been visualized in a holistic approach considering the critical issues that are daunting in the domain. The proposed framework for fingerprint template protection has been developed in such a way that it is as easy as possible to implement. The results are fairly consistent when tested with different datasets. Experimental results show that proposed work is highly accurate and secure with a very low EER % of 0.1%.
